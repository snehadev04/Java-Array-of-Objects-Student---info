# Java-Array-of-Objects-Student---info

Welcome to the Java Student Array repository! This project illustrates array-of-object handling with student data in Java.

## Description:
The repository contains a Java program that demonstrates how to manage student data using arrays. 
The student class defines the structure of a student object with attributes such as roll number, name, and marks. 
The array class contains the main method where student objects are created, stored in an array, and then printed out using both traditional and enhanced for-loops.

## Usage:
To explore this project:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
4. Compile the Java files using the command: javac array.java
5. Run the compiled program using the command: java array
   
Observe the output, which prints the details of each student stored in the array.

## Features:

Array-of-Object Handling: Understand how to manage student data using arrays of objects in Java.
Efficient Printing: Learn how to efficiently print out student details using both traditional and enhanced for-loops.
Versatility: Explore various use cases of arrays and objects, gaining insights into their handling and manipulation in Java programming.
